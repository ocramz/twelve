# twelve

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ocramz/twelve.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ocramz/twelve)

Like [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), but this goes to 12.

## What

This is a very simplified static site generator, inspired by 11ty.

## Why

`twelve` was created for three reasons:

    * Modularity
    
    * Betting on Haskell
    
    * Not a JavaScript Framework
